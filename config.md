# Configuring PMS

This document aims to document all configuration options, commands, variables, and functionality.

Literal text is spelled out normally, along with `<required>` parameters and `[optional]` parameters.

## Options

### center

```
set center
set nocenter
```

If set, the viewport is automatically moved so that the cursor stays in the center, if possible.

### columns

```
set columns=artist,track,title,album,year,time
```

Defines which tags should be shown in the tracklist.

### sort

```
set sort=file,track,disc,album,year,albumartistsort
```

Set default sort order, for when using `sort` without any parameters.

### topbar

```
set topbar="|$shortname $version||;${tag|artist} - ${tag|title}||${tag|album}, ${tag|year};$volume $mode $elapsed ${state} $time;|[${list|index}/${list|total}] ${list|title}||;;"
```

Define the layout and visible items in the _top bar_.

The top bar is an informational area where information about the current state of both MPD and PMS is shown.

#### Special characters

* `|` divides the line into one more piece.
* `;` starts a new line.
* `$` selects a variable. You can use either `${variable|parameter}` or `$variable`.
* `\` escapes the special meaning of the next character, so it will be printed literally.

#### Variables

* `${elapsed}` is the time elapsed in the current track.
* `${list}`
    * `${list|index}` is the numeric index of the current tracklist.
    * `${list|title}` is the title of the current tracklist.
    * `${list|total}` is the total number of tracklists.
* `${mode}` is the status of the player switches `consume`, `random`, `single`, and `repeat`, printed as four characters (`czsr`).
* `${shortname}` is the short name of this program.
* `${state}`
    * `${state}` is the current player state, represented as a two-character ASCII art.
    * `${state|unicode}` is the current player state, represented with unicode symbols.
* `${tag|<tag>}` is a specific tag in the currently playing song.
* `${time}` is the total length of the current track.
* `${version}` is the git version this program was compiled from.
* `${volume}` is the current volume, or `MUTE` if the volume is zero.

#### Examples

One line, showing player state, artist, and track title.

```
set topbar="${state|unicode} ${tag|artist} - ${tag|title}"
```

One line, with left- and right-justified text.

```
set topbar="this text is to the left|this text is to the right"
```

Three lines containing center-justified text on the middle line.

```
set topbar=";|this text is in the center||;;"
```

## Commands

### add

```
add [uri] [uri...]
```

Adds one or more URI's to MPD's queue. If no URI's are specified, the current tracklist selection is assumed.

### bind

```
bind <key sequence> <command>
```

Binds a key sequence to execute a command.

A _key sequence_ may be either
* a string of letters,
* a string of `<special>` keys, such as `<space>` or `<f1>`
* a string of keys with modifiers, such as `<Ctrl-X>`, `<Alt-A>`, or `<Shift-Escape>`,
* or a combination of all three, such as `<Ctrl-X><Delete>quit`.

Modifier keys are `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Meta`, and `Shift`. The first letter of these four words can also be used as a shorthand.

Special keys are too many to list here, but can be found in the [complete list of special keys](keysequence/names.go).

Regular keys such as letters, numbers, symbols, unicode characters, etc. will never have the `Shift` modifier key. Generally, terminal applications have far less visibility into keyboard
activity than graphical applications. Hence, you should avoid depending overly much on availability of modifiers, or the availability of any specific keys.

### copy

`copy` is an alias for [yank](#yank).

### cursor

```
cursor current
cursor down
cursor end
cursor home
cursor nextOf [tag] [tag...]
cursor pagedn
cursor pagedown
cursor pageup
cursor pgdn
cursor pgup
cursor prevOf [tag] [tag...]
cursor random
cursor up
cursor <+N>
cursor <-N>
cursor <N>
```

Moves the cursor. `current` moves to the currently playing song. `random` picks a random song from the tracklist.

The `nextOf` and `prevOf` commands locates the next or previous track that has different tags from the track under the cursor. Multiple tags are allowed.

The cursor can also be set to a relative or absolute position using the three last forms.

### cut

```
cut
```

Removes the current selection from the tracklist, and replace the clipboard contents with the removed tracks.

### inputmode

```
inputmode normal
inputmode input
inputmode search
```

Switches between modes. Normal mode is where key bindings take effect. Input mode allows commands to be typed in, while search mode executes searches while you type.

### isolate

```
isolate <tag> [tag...]
```

Searches for songs with similar tags as the current selection, and creates a new tracklist. The tracklist is sorted by the default sort criteria.

### list
### next
### pause
### paste

```
paste
paste before
paste after
```

Insert the contents of the clipboard before or after the cursor position. If no position is given, `after` is assumed.

### play

```
play
play cursor
play selection
```

Start playing. Without any parameters, `play` will resume playing MPD's current song, or start from the beginning of the queue.

If invoked with the `cursor` argument, `play` will add the song under the cursor to the queue if necessary, and start playing.

The `selection` argument is like `cursor`, but adds the entire selection to the queue, and starts playing from the first selected song. If there is no selection, fall back to the cursor.

### prev
### previous
### print
### q

`q` is an alias for [quit](#quit).

### quit

```
quit
```

Exit the program. Any unsaved changes will be lost.

### redraw

```
redraw
```

Force a screen redraw. Useful if rendering has gone wrong.

### se

`se` is an alias for [set](#set).

### select

```
select toggle
select visual
select nearby <tag> [tag...]
```

Manipulate tracklist selection.

`visual` will toggle _visual mode_ and anchor the selection on the track under the cursor.

`toggle` will toggle selection status for the track under the cursor. If in visual mode when using `toggle`, the visual selection will be converted to manual selection, and visual mode switched off.

`nearby` will set the visual selection to nearby tracks having the same specified _tags_ as the track under the cursor. If there is already a visual selection, it will be cleared instead.

### seek

```
seek <+N>
seek <-N>
seek <N>
```

Skip forwards or backwards in the current track. It is also possible to seek to an absolute position.

### set

```
set option=value
set option
set nooption
set invoption
set option?
set option!
```

Change global program options. Boolean options are enabled with `set option` and disabled with `set nooption`. The value can be flipped using `set invoption` or `set option!`. Values can be queried using `set option?`.

### single

```
single on
single off
single toggle
```

`single` is an alias for `single toggle`.

Turn MPD's single mode playback style on or off.

### sort

```
sort
sort <tag> [tag...]
```

Sort the current tracklist by the specified tags. The most significant sort criteria is specified last. The first sort is performed as an unstable sort, while the remainder is a stable sort.

If no tags are given, the tracklist is sorted by the tags specified in the `sort` option.

### stop

```
stop
```

Stops playback.

### style

```
style <name> [foreground [background]] [bold] [underline] [reverse] [blink]
```

Specify the style of an UI item.

Colors are either literal names, such as `red`, `yellow`, or `green`, or hexadecimal color values such as `@ff0077`. The hash sign `#` is used for comments; the at sign `@` is used instead. A full list of supported color names can be found in the [tcell documentation](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/blob/master/color.go#L820).

The keywords `bold`, `underline`, `reverse`, and `blink` can be specified literally. Any keyword order is accepted, but the foreground color must come prior to the background color, if specified.

#### Stylable UI items

##### Tags

Any _tag_, such as `artist`, `album`, `date`, `time`, etc. can be styled. These tags are not included in this list. Their styles apply both to the tracklist and in the top bar. All tag names are in lowercase.

##### Tracklist

* `allTagsMissing` - song style in the tracklist when all the _essential_ tags are missing (`artist`, `album`, and `title`).
* `currentSong` - color of the entire line in the tracklist, highlighting the currently playing song.
* `cursor` - color of the entire line in the tracklist, highlighting the cursor position.
* `header` - column headers showing tag names.
* `mostTagsMissing` - song style in the tracklist when _most_ tags are missing (`artist` and `title`).
* `selection` - line color of selected songs.

##### Top bar

See the [topbar setting](#topbar) for the corresponding variables.

* `elapsed` - corresponds to `${elapsed}`.
* `listIndex` - corresponds to `${list|index}`.
* `listTitle` - corresponds to `${list|title}`.
* `listTotal` - corresponds to `${list|total}`.
* `mute` - the color of the `${volume}` widget when the volume is zero.
* `shortName` - corresponds to `${elapsed}`.
* `state` - corresponds to `${elapsed}`.

* `tagMissing` - the color used for tag styling when the tag is missing.
* `topbar` - the default color of the top bar text and whitespace.
* `version` - corresponds to `${elapsed}`.
* `volume` - corresponds to `${volume}`.

##### Statusbar

* `commandText` - text color when writing text in command input mode.
* `errorText` - text color of error messages in the status bar.
* `readout` - position readout at the bottom right.
* `searchText` - text color when searching.
* `sequenceText` - text color of uncompleted keyboard bindings.

* `visualText` - text color of the `-- VISUAL --` text when selecting songs in visual mode.

### volume

```
volume <+N>
volume <-N>
volume <N>
